As an AI agent, I have certain limitations when it comes to generating and verifying this ASP.NET Core Crash Course project:

1.  **No Code Execution or Real-time Testing:**
    *   I cannot compile the .NET project to check for build errors beyond static analysis.
    *   I cannot run the application to perform manual testing of MVC pages, API endpoints, or frontend JavaScript interactions.
    *   I cannot execute database migrations (`Add-Migration`, `Update-Database`) to ensure they work correctly with the defined `DbContext` and connection string.

2.  **No Automated Test Execution:**
    *   While I can write unit tests or integration tests, I cannot execute them to verify their success or failure. This project, being a foundational crash course, does not include a test suite as part of its plan.

3.  **No Environment Setup or External Tool Interaction:**
    *   I cannot install .NET SDKs, Visual Studio, or SQL Server Express LocalDB on a user's machine. The `README.md` provides instructions, but I can't perform these steps.
    *   I cannot directly interact with external tools like Postman or Swagger UI to test API endpoints.

4.  **No Visual Verification:**
    *   I cannot visually inspect the rendered web pages to ensure they look correct or that CSS/styling is applied as expected beyond the code provided.

5.  **No NuGet Package Resolution Verification:**
    *   While I can add `<PackageReference>` entries to the `.csproj` file, I cannot verify if these packages will be successfully restored without conflicts in a real environment. I rely on common compatible versions.

6.  **No Real-world Database Interaction:**
    *   I can define the `DbContext` and seed data, but I cannot confirm successful connection to a database server or that CRUD operations perform as intended against a live database.

The project is created based on my knowledge of ASP.NET Core best practices and common structures. The user is expected to follow the `README.md` instructions to set up, compile, migrate the database, run, and manually test the application to fully verify its functionality.
