## 1. Introduction to ASP.NET

**What is ASP.NET?**
ASP.NET Core is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It's a successor to the older ASP.NET Framework (which was Windows-only).

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **High Performance:** ASP.NET Core is designed for speed and scalability.
*   **Unified MVC and Web API:** In ASP.NET Core, the frameworks for building web UI (Model-View-Controller) and web APIs are unified, making development more streamlined.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Built-in support for dependency injection, which promotes loosely coupled and testable code.
*   **Open Source:** The source code is available on GitHub, and it has a vibrant community.

**Place in the .NET Ecosystem:**
ASP.NET Core is part of the broader .NET platform. The .NET platform includes:
*   **Runtimes:** For executing code.
*   **SDKs (Software Development Kits):** Tools for building applications.
*   **Languages:** Primarily C#, but also F# and VB.NET.
*   **Libraries:** A vast set of libraries (Base Class Library - BCL) for common tasks.

**Different ASP.NET Technologies (Focus on ASP.NET Core):**
*   **ASP.NET Core MVC:** For building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
*   **ASP.NET Core Web API:** For building RESTful HTTP services.
*   **Razor Pages:** A page-based programming model.
*   **Blazor:** A framework for building interactive client-side web UIs with .NET.

**C# - The Primary Language:**
C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language, the main language for ASP.NET development.

## 7. Authentication and Authorization (Overview)

Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is. Authorization is the process of verifying what a user is allowed to do. These are critical aspects of most web applications.

ASP.NET Core provides a powerful and flexible system for handling security called **ASP.NET Core Identity**.

**Key Features of ASP.NET Core Identity:**
*   **User Management:** Support for creating users, managing user profiles (usernames, passwords, email, phone numbers, etc.).
*   **Password Hashing:** Automatically handles secure password hashing and verification.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Cookie-based authentication:** Default for web UI applications. After a user signs in, a cookie is issued that is used to authenticate subsequent requests.
    *   **Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens):** Commonly used for APIs and single-page applications (SPAs).
*   **External Logins:** Support for third-party login providers like Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, Twitter, etc.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Support for adding an extra layer of security.
*   **Role-based Authorization:** Assign users to roles (e.g., "Admin", "Member") and restrict access to resources based on these roles.
*   **Policy-based Authorization:** Define custom authorization policies for more granular control.
*   **UI Scaffolding:** Visual Studio and the .NET CLI can scaffold default Identity UI pages (login, register, manage account, etc.) into your project.

**How to get started with ASP.NET Core Identity:**
1.  **Add NuGet Packages:**
    *   `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore` (to store Identity data using EF Core)
    *   `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI` (for default UI, if needed)
2.  **Configure DbContext:** Your `ApplicationDbContext` would need to inherit from `IdentityDbContext<YourUserClass>` instead of just `DbContext`. `YourUserClass` can be the default `IdentityUser` or a custom class inheriting from it.
    ```csharp
    // Example:
    // public class ApplicationUser : IdentityUser { /* Custom properties */ }
    // public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
    // {
    //     public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options) { }
    //     // Your DbSets for other application data like Products
    //     public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    // }
    ```
3.  **Configure Services in `Program.cs`:**
    ```csharp
    // builder.Services.AddDefaultIdentity<ApplicationUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
    //     .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

    // Or for more control:
    // builder.Services.AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole>()
    //    .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
    //    .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

    // builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options => { /* ... */ }); // Configure schemes if not using AddIdentity's defaults
    // builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options => { /* ... */ }); // Configure policies
    ```
4.  **Add Middleware in `Program.cs` (order is important):**
    ```csharp
    // app.UseRouting(); // Already there
    // app.UseAuthentication(); // IMPORTANT: Must come AFTER UseRouting and BEFORE UseAuthorization and MapEndpoints/MapControllers
    // app.UseAuthorization(); // IMPORTANT: Must come AFTER UseAuthentication
    // app.MapRazorPages(); // If you scaffolded Identity UI which are Razor Pages
    // app.MapDefaultControllerRoute(); // Or your specific routes
    ```
5.  **Scaffold Identity UI (Optional but common for web apps):**
    *   In Visual Studio: Right-click project > Add > New Scaffolded Item > Identity. Select the pages you want, your DbContext, and user class.
    *   Via .NET CLI: `dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity -dc AspNetCrashCourse.Data.ApplicationDbContext --files "Account.Register;Account.Login;Account.Logout;Account.ManageNav" UserClass=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser` (Adjust `UserClass` if you have a custom one)
6.  **Protect Controllers/Actions:**
    *   Use the `[Authorize]` attribute on controllers or action methods.
    *   `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`
    *   `[Authorize(Policy = "CanEditProducts")]`
7.  **Database Migrations:** Add new migrations for the Identity tables (`Add-Migration AddIdentitySchema`) and update the database (`Update-Database`).

**For APIs:**
*   Token-based authentication (JWT Bearer tokens) is common.
*   Packages like `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` are used.
*   Clients (e.g., SPAs, mobile apps) obtain a token after logging in and send it in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests.
*   Configuration in `Program.cs` involves:
    ```csharp
    // builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    // .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    // {
    //     options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    //     {
    //         ValidateIssuer = true,
    //         ValidateAudience = true,
    //         ValidateLifetime = true,
    //         ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
    //         ValidIssuer = builder.Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
    //         ValidAudience = builder.Configuration["Jwt:Audience"],
    //         IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(builder.Configuration["Jwt:Key"]))
    //     };
    // });
    ```
    (This requires adding `Jwt:Issuer`, `Jwt:Audience`, `Jwt:Key` to `appsettings.json`).

This is a high-level overview. Implementing robust authentication and authorization requires careful consideration of security best practices. Refer to the official Microsoft documentation for detailed guidance. It's a significant topic on its own.

## 8. Deployment (Overview)

Once your ASP.NET Core application is built and tested, you need to deploy it to a hosting environment so users can access it. ASP.NET Core's cross-platform nature offers various deployment options.

**Key Deployment Concepts:**
*   **Publishing:** The process of preparing your application for deployment. This typically involves compiling your code, including necessary runtime files (if self-contained), and packaging static content. You can publish from Visual Studio (right-click project > Publish) or using the .NET CLI (`dotnet publish -c Release`).
*   **Deployment Models:**
    *   **Framework-dependent deployment (FDD):** Your application relies on a .NET runtime being installed on the target server. This results in smaller deployment packages.
    *   **Self-contained deployment (SCD):** The .NET runtime and libraries are packaged with your application. The target server doesn't need .NET pre-installed, but deployment packages are larger.
*   **Hosting Environment:** The server or service that will run your application.

**Common Deployment Targets/Methods:**

1.  **Azure App Service:**
    *   Microsoft's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering.
    *   Excellent integration with Visual Studio and .NET.
    *   Handles infrastructure, patching, scaling, and load balancing.
    *   Supports deployment via Git, CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions), FTP, or directly from Visual Studio.
    *   Offers various pricing tiers, including a free tier for development/testing.

2.  **IIS (Internet Information Services) on Windows Server:**
    *   A traditional way to host ASP.NET applications.
    *   Requires a Windows Server with IIS installed and configured.
    *   The ASP.NET Core Hosting Bundle must be installed on the server. This bundle includes the .NET Core runtime, .NET Core Library, and the ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM), which allows IIS to reverse proxy requests to your Kestrel server.
    *   Deployment can be done by copying published files to the server or using Web Deploy.

3.  **Linux with a Reverse Proxy Server (Nginx or Apache):**
    *   ASP.NET Core apps run with an in-process HTTP server called Kestrel. While Kestrel is fast, it's recommended to use a more robust web server like Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy in front of it for production Linux deployments.
    *   The reverse proxy handles tasks like SSL termination, request forwarding, caching, and load balancing.
    *   You'll need to configure Nginx/Apache to forward requests to your Kestrel process (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
    *   Systemd or Supervisor can be used to manage your Kestrel process (start, stop, restart on failure).

4.  **Docker Containers:**
    *   Containerizing your ASP.NET Core application with Docker provides portability, consistency, and scalability.
    *   Microsoft provides official .NET Docker images.
    *   You create a `Dockerfile` that defines how to build your application's image.
    *   These container images can then be run on any Docker host (local machine, on-premises server, cloud container services).
    *   **Cloud Container Services:**
        *   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** For orchestrating containerized applications at scale.
        *   **Azure Container Instances (ACI):** For running single containers or simple applications without orchestration.
        *   **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), AWS Fargate, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** Similar offerings from other cloud providers.

5.  **Serverless (e.g., Azure Functions):**
    *   For certain API workloads or smaller microservices, you might consider deploying parts of your application as serverless functions.
    *   ASP.NET Core can be run within an Azure Function.

**General Deployment Considerations:**
*   **Configuration:** Manage environment-specific settings (database connections, API keys) using `appsettings.{Environment}.json`, environment variables, or services like Azure Key Vault. **Never hardcode secrets in your source code.**
*   **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to track application health and diagnose issues in production.
*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production. Configure SSL certificates appropriately for your chosen hosting environment.
*   **Database:** Your production database will likely be different from your local development database (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS, or a dedicated SQL Server instance).

Choosing the right deployment strategy depends on your application's requirements, your team's expertise, scalability needs, and budget. For entry-level roles, familiarity with publishing from Visual Studio, deploying to Azure App Service, or understanding the basics of IIS/Nginx reverse proxy setups would be beneficial.
