# This file is where you write tests for your application.
# Django provides a testing framework based on Python's unittest module.
# Writing tests is crucial for ensuring your code behaves as expected,
# preventing regressions, and making your application more robust.

# You can write different types of tests:
# - Model tests: Verify the logic within your models (e.g., custom methods, validation).
# - View tests: Check that your views render correctly, handle different HTTP methods,
#   perform correct database operations, and return appropriate responses.
# - Form tests: Ensure your forms validate data correctly.
# - Integration tests: Test how different parts of your application work together.

from django.test import TestCase
# from .models import TodoItem # Example: Import models if you're testing them
# from django.urls import reverse # Example: For testing URLs/views

# Example of a simple test case:
# class TodoAppTests(TestCase):
#     def test_example_test(self):
#         """An example test that always passes."""
#         self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

#     def test_todo_item_creation(self):
#         """Test creating a TodoItem instance."""
#         # TodoItem.objects.create(title="Test task", completed=False)
#         # self.assertEqual(TodoItem.objects.count(), 1)
#         pass # Replace with actual test logic

# For this project, we are not implementing specific tests as per the initial request's focus
# on building the structure and adding comments for learning purposes. However, in a real-world
# scenario, adding comprehensive tests here would be a critical next step.
