# Random Color Palette Generator

This is a simple backendless web application that allows users to generate random color palettes. It's designed for front-end developers, website designers, or anyone who needs quick color inspiration.

## Features

*   **Random Palette Generation**: Click a button to instantly generate a new palette of 5 colors.
*   **Visual Swatches**: Colors are displayed as clear visual swatches.
*   **Hex Codes**: The hexadecimal code for each color is displayed below its swatch.
*   **Copy to Clipboard**: Click on any color swatch or its hex code to copy the hex code to your clipboard. Visual feedback is provided upon successful copy.
*   **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **No Dependencies**: Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or frameworks are required.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

That's it! You can start generating color palettes immediately.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for color generation, display, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from websites like:

*   [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
*   [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/)

While simpler in its current form, it aims to provide a quick and easy tool for color discovery.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Allow users to specify the number of colors per palette.
*   Implement different color harmony rules (e.g., complementary, analogous, triadic).
*   Save favorite palettes (e.g., using local storage).
*   Display color information in other formats (RGB, HSL).
*   Dark mode.
*   Ability to manually adjust colors in a palette.
